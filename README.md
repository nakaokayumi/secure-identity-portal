## 📌 Project Overview
A full-stack cloud-based Identity & Access Management (IAM) system built with a **security-first design approach**.

The platform provides secure user authentication, protected account access, and structured audit logging for monitoring and traceability.  
Developed independently to demonstrate real-world defensive web security practices and cloud deployment architecture.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- PBKDF2 password hashing with SHA-256 salting  
- No plaintext credential storage  
- Protected login workflow  

### 🧭 Session Protection
- Server-side session enforcement  
- Authenticated route access control  

### 📊 Audit Logging
- Login activity tracking  
- Timestamped authentication records  
- IP address traceability  

### 🧾 Data Privacy Controls
- Permanent account deletion  
- User control over stored personal data  

### 🧩 Protected Resource Demonstration
- Session-restricted interactive module (Hangman Protocol)

## ☁️ System Architecture

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python Flask |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) |
| Hosting | Render |
| Security | PBKDF2 SHA-256, parameterized SQL |
| Environment | Python virtual environments |

Application hosting and data storage are separated to reflect real-world cloud deployment practices.

## 🛡️ Security Design Principles
- Encrypted credential storage  
- SQL injection prevention  
- Session-based access control  
- Authentication activity monitoring  
- Forensic traceability of login events  

---

## 📊 Industry Skill Mapping

| Skill | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Networking & HTTP | Routing, authentication flows, session handling |
| Environment Management | Isolated development using Python venv |
| Data Confidentiality | Parameterized queries and hashed password storage |

---

## 🖥️ Monitoring & Audit Trail
The system maintains a chronological record of authentication activity including user email and IP address, supporting investigation of unauthorized access attempts.
